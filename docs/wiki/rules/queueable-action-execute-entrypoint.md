# QueueableAction execute entrypoint

Every PHP class under `Modules/Activity/app/Actions/` uses `Spatie\QueueableAction\QueueableAction` and exposes an `execute(...)` method.

Example: `RecordSubjectActivityAction::execute(...)` is the canonical subject-recording entrypoint.

Compatibility methods such as `ActivityLogger::log()` or `ActivityRecorder::record()` may remain only as wrappers; new code calls `execute(...)` on the target action.
